# Quoridor
Quoridor is an exciting and interactive board game designed for 2 players. The game board consists of a grid, and each player starts with a pawn positioned at one end of the board. The primary goal is to be the first to reach the opposite side of the board.
What sets Quoridor apart is the inclusion of walls, which players can strategically place to block the paths of their opponents. The catch is that each player has a limited number of walls, adding a tactical element to the game. Players can choose to either move their pawn or strategically position a wall during their turn.
